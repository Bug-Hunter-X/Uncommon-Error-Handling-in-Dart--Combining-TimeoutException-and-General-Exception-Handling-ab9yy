# Uncommon Error Handling in Dart: Combining TimeoutException and General Exception Handling

This example showcases a robust approach to error handling in Dart.  It specifically addresses the situation where a `TimeoutException` might occur alongside other potential exceptions during an asynchronous operation.

The `fetchData()` function simulates an asynchronous task that can throw different types of exceptions. The `try-catch` block effectively handles:

- `TimeoutException`: Catches and handles `TimeoutException` specifically.
- `Exception`: Catches other general exceptions using a separate `catch` block for more precise error management.
- `catch (e, stacktrace)`: Includes a general catch-all block to log unexpected errors, which is crucial for debugging.

This is a good practice to improve the resilience of your Dart applications and provides comprehensive error logging.
